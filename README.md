# MRNQCK BOT
## A simple Discord Bot I use to further develop my Java "skills"
Please do not take this Project too serious, I am only starting to learn Java!

## How to Use
Currently there is no stable Build available, if you want to Use the Bot for yourself or host a own Instance, you need to set the Bot Token in the Main method and Compile everything yourself. Please note that I do not guarantee for any errors, bugs, vulnarabilities and so on! Also you need to import Following Libraries:
